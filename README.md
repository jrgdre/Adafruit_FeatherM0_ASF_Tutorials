Tutorials on how to program Adafruit's FeatherM0-WiFi using AtmelStudio and the Atmel Software Framework (ASF)
==============================================================================================================

These tutorials try to explain how to use different functions of the Atmel ATSAMD21G18A based Adafruit FeatherM0-WiFi board, using AtmelStudio and the Atmel Software Framework.

You will need an external Programmer/Debugger for this to work. The Atmel ICE SAM works great for me.

Read http://drechsler-it.de/Electronics_Adafruit_FeatherM0_WiFi.html if you are interested in how to hook it up.

These tutorials are about how to work directly with the SAMD MCU on-board.
